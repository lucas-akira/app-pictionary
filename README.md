# app-pictionary
Full stack web implementation of the game

## Introduction
This project is a work in progress full stack implementation of the game Pictionary. The objective was to learn general modern web programming practices, APIs and frameworks, from the point of view of someone who didn't have any web development background prior to this project (except for basic HTML and CSS).

### The game

### Requisites
The user, upon entering the site should:
- Be able to login as a normal user or as an administrator (that requires a password)
- See the list of available matches
- Join in an available match if logged in
- Inside a match, a player:
    - Be able to input text (to guess the word)
    - See the white board being drawn by the match host (it shouldn't be editable by the user)
- Inside a match (as the host):
    - Receive a random word to draw
    - Be able to draw in the whiteboard
